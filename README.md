This project utilizes AngularJS, MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS. The project has login vaildation after you register your name. Once logged in, the user can create a poll survery where all other users can vote on the survery. All poll surveys have validation errors when being created. The user can also delete the poll they created and log out. AngularJS is used in the front end and Express is used for the back end. MongoDB is used for the database and it is a NoSQL database. I also utilize Mongoose to have the back end communicate with the database.
